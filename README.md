# Project Overview

This project, implemented in Python, focuses on exploring the distribution of vegan and vegetarian restaurants in Chennai. The primary data source is the Foursquare API, providing 4700 datapoints for analysis. 

## Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Leveraged the Foursquare API to gather information on various venues in Chennai.

2. **Clustering Analysis**: Utilized K-Means clustering to identify areas with the highest density of vegan and vegetarian restaurants.

3. **Data Processing**: One-hot encoding was applied to the gathered data to prepare it for input into the K-Means clustering model.

4. **Visualization**: The results of the clustering analysis were visualized on a map for a clear representation of restaurant distribution.

5. **Location Extraction**: Leveraged Selenium to scrape and compile a list of all locations in Chennai from the Wikipedia page.
